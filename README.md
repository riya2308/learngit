Start the Chrome WebDriver:
Ensure you have already set up the Chrome WebDriver correctly. This is usually done with lines like:

java
Copy code
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path_to_chromedriver");
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
Navigate to the Voltaire webpage:
You mentioned that you've configured the Chrome driver to open the Voltaire webpage. You can navigate to a URL with:

java
Copy code
driver.get("http://voltaire.webfarm.ms.com/requestor/create");
Wait for Elements to Load:
You can use WebDriverWait to ensure that the page elements are fully loaded before you try to interact with them.

java
Copy code
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("someElementId")));
Interact with the Form:
Replace the PowerShell commands that send keystrokes with Selenium commands that directly manipulate form elements. For example:

Select Region and Share Information:
If the form fields are dropdowns or input fields, you can use Select for dropdowns and send keys to inputs.

java
Copy code
Select regionDropdown = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("regionDropdownId")));
regionDropdown.selectByVisibleText("Asia Pacific");

WebElement shareInput = driver.findElement(By.id("shareInputId"));
shareInput.sendKeys("1000");  // Example: sending '1000' to share input
Navigate through Form:
Use WebElement to find buttons and then .click() to interact with them.

java
Copy code
WebElement nextButton = driver.findElement(By.id("nextButtonId"));
nextButton.click();
Submit the Form:
After filling out all necessary fields, find the submit button and click it.

java
Copy code
WebElement submitButton = driver.findElement(By.id("submitButtonId"));
submitButton.click();
Error Handling and Cleanup:
Make sure to include error handling (try-catch blocks) to handle potential exceptions. Also, ensure you close the browser after the script completes:

java
Copy code
driver.quit();
This is a basic structure to help you automate your web interactions using Selenium and Java, matching the steps you previously used with PowerShell. Adjust the element selectors (By.id, By.xpath, etc.) to match the actual elements in the Voltaire form you are working with.
